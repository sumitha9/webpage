        <p style="width:50%"> House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker. That
            is what makes them so unique
            and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the roaster and/or
            distributor.
            For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in
            1971. The
            one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true
            reflection of us and
            delicious cup of coffee, period.”
